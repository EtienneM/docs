<h4 id="v23-2-0-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h4>

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v23.2]({% link v23.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes, as well as key cluster setting changes, and adjust your deployment as necessary.

<!-- alpha.1 TODO: Remove this comment -->
- The pre-v23.1 output produced by `SHOW RANGES`, `crdb_internal.ranges`, and `crdb_internal.ranges_no_leases` was deprecated in v23.1 and is now replaced by default with output that's compatible with coalesced ranges (anges that pack multiple tables/indexes/partitions into individual ranges). See the [v23.1 release notes]({% link releases/v23.1.md %}) for `SHOW RANGES` for more details. [#102961][#102961]
- When a deployment is configured to use a time zone (new feature) for log file output using formats `crdb-v1` or `crdb-v2`, it becomes impossible to process the new output log files using the [`cockroach debug merge-logs` command]({% link v23.2/cockroach-debug-merge-logs.md %}) from a previous version. The newest `cockroach debug merge-logs` code must be used instead. [#104265][#104265]
- When customizing the [SQL shell's interactive prompt]({% link v23.2/cockroach-sql.md %}), the special sequence `%M` now expands to the full host name instead of the combination of host name and port number. To include the port number explicitly, use `%>`. The special sequence `%m` now expands to the host name up to the first period. [#105137][#105137]
- The [`cockroach debug zip`]({% link v23.2/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}) command stores data retrieved from SQL tables in the remote cluster using the TSV format by default. [#107474][#107474]
<!-- alpha.3 TODO: Remove this comment -->
- The direct export of traces to Jaeger and the [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `trace.jaeger.agent` have been removed. The direct export functionality had been obsoleted since 2022; it stopped working altogether sometime in 2023 with the following error: `data does not fit within one UDP packet; size 65006, max 65000, spans NN`. Since 2022, Jaeger supports ingestion of traces using OTLP; and CockroachDB has supported emitting traces using OTLP since v22.1. Operators and developers who want to inspect traces are thus invited to use the OTLP protocol instead. The corresponding cluster setting is `trace.opentelemetry.collector`. For a successful deployment, an intermediate OTLP collector/forwarder should be configured.
  - You can orchestrate the OpenTelemetry collector and Jaeger together using Docker Compose by adapting the following example:

    ~~~ yaml
    otel-collector:
      image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
      container_name: otel-collector
      volumes:
        - ./otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
      ports:
        - 1888:1888 # pprof extension
        - 8888:8888 # Prometheus metrics exposed by the collector
        - 8889:8889 # Prometheus exporter metrics
        - 13133:13133 # health_check extension
        - 4317:4317 # OTLP gRPC receiver
        - 4318:4318 # OTLP http receiver
        - 55679:55679 # zpages extension

    jaeger:
      image: jaegertracing/all-in-one
      container_name: jaeger
      ports:
        - "16685:16685"
        - "16686:16686"
        - "14250:14250"
        - "14268:14268"
        - "14269:14269"
        - "6831:6831/udp"
      environment:
        - COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411
        - COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true
    ~~~

  - To configure the `otel-collector`, you can adapt this example:

    ~~~ yaml
    receivers:
      otlp: # the OTLP receiver the app is sending traces to
        protocols:
          grpc:
          http:

    processors:
      batch:

    exporters:
      otlp/jaeger: # Jaeger supports OTLP directly
        endpoint: http://jaeger:4317
        tls:
          insecure: true

    service:
      pipelines:
        traces/dev:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp/jaeger]
    ~~~

  To use this configuration, unset Jaeger via `SET CLUSTER SETTING trace.jaeger.agent=''`, and then set the OTLP collector using `SET CLUSTER SETTING trace.opentelemetry.collector='localhost:4317'`.

<h4 id="v23-2-0-cluster-settings">Key Cluster Setting Changes</h4>

The following changes should be reviewed prior to upgrading. Default cluster settings will be used unless you have manually set a value for a setting. This can be confirmed by checking the `system.settings` table (`select * from system.settings`) to view the non-default settings.

<!-- Rolled up from alpha.1 through beta.3 -->
- The new [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `sql.txn.read_committed_syntax.enabled`, controls whether transactions run under `READ COMMITTED` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation. It defaults to `false`. When set to `true`, the following statements will configure transactions to run under `READ COMMITTED` isolation:

  - `BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED`
  - `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED`
  - `SET default_transaction_isolation = 'read committed'`
  - `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED`

    [#110624][#110624]
- The `sql.txn.read_committed_syntax.enabled` [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) was renamed to [`sql.txn.read_committed_isolation.enabled`](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-txn-read-committed-isolation-enabled). [#113833][#113833]
- Users who have the [`CREATEROLE` role option]({% link v23.2/grant.md %}) can now grant and revoke role membership in any non-admin role. This change also removes the [`sql.auth.createrole_allows_grant_role_membership.enabled` cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}), which was added in v23.1. In v23.2, the cluster setting is effectively always true. [#104376][#104376]
- The [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings) `sql.metrics.statement_details.gateway_node.enabled` now defaults to false to reduce the number of rows generated in SQL Statistics pages. [#107788][#107788]
- The [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `kv.rangefeed.enabled` no longer controls access to `RANGEFEED SQL` commands. Instead, use `feature.changefeed.enabled`. [#110676][#110676]
- The [cluster settings]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) related to [physical cluster replication](../v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.html) have been renamed for consistency. For example, `bulkio.stream_ingestion.minimum_flush_interval` is now named `physical_replication.consumer.minimum_flush_interval`. [#111197][#111197]
- CockroachDB now periodically dumps the state of its internal memory accounting system into the `heap_profiler/` directory when a heap profile is taken. To disable this behavior, set the `diagnostics.memory_monitoring_dumps.enabled` [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) to `false`. [#114998][#114998]
- Introduced the [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `kv.gc.sticky_hint.enabled` in v23.1.13. This setting helps expedite [garbage collection](../v23.2/architecture/storage-layer.html#garbage-collection) after range deletions. For example, when a SQL table or index is dropped. `kv.gc.sticky_hint.enabled` is enabled by default and deprecated in v23.2. [#113040][#113040]
- CockroachDB now enables the pacing mechanism in rangefeed closed timestamp notifications, by setting the default `kv.rangefeed.closed_timestamp_smear_interval` cluster setting to 1ms. This makes rangefeed closed timestamp delivery more uniform and less spikey, which reduces its impact on the Go scheduler and, ultimately, foreground SQL latencies. [#103006][#103006]
