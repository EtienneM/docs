variable. When set to true, any schema change statement that is sent
during an explicit transaction will cause the transaction to commit
before executing the schema change.
This setting can be used to improve compatibility with some tools that
do not work well due to our limitations with schema changes in explicit
transactions. It also can be used to use schema changes under READ
COMMITTED more easily, without needing to teach the schema changer about
READ COMMITTED.</p>

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The following are [enterprise-only](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v24.1/enterprise-licensing) features. [Request a 30-day trial license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/enterprise/) to try them out.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

- The [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link v24.1/read-committed.md %}) isolation level now requires the cluster to have a valid [enterprise license](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v24.1/licensing-faqs#obtain-a-license). Otherwise, transactions which are configured to run as `READ COMMITTED` will be upgraded to [`SERIALIZABLE`]({% link v24.1/demo-serializable.md %}), as described in [Backward-incompatible changes](#read-committed-transaction-upgrade). [#120154](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/120154)

<h4 id="v24-1-0-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h4>

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v24.1]({% link v24.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes, as well as [key cluster setting changes](#v24-1-0-cluster-settings), and adjust your deployment as necessary.

- [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`]({% link v23.2/as-of-system-time.md %}) queries can no longer use a timestamp followed by a question mark to signify a future-time value. This was an undocumented syntax. [#116830](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/116830)
- The [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link v24.1/read-committed.md %}) isolation level now requires the cluster to have a valid [enterprise license](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v24.1/licensing-faqs#obtain-a-license). Otherwise, transactions which are configured to run as `READ COMMITTED` will be upgraded to [`SERIALIZABLE`]({% link v24.1/demo-serializable.md %}), as described in the next note. [#120154](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/120154)
- <a id="read-committed-transaction-upgrade"></a>The `sql.txn.read_committed_isolation.enabled` [cluster setting]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}) is now `true` by default. As a result, [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link v24.1/read-committed.md %}) transactions are **not** automatically upgraded to [`SERIALIZABLE`]({% link v24.1/demo-serializable.md %}), and will run as `READ COMMITTED` by default. On v23.2, refer to the [**Upgrades of SQL Transaction Isolation Level**]({% link v24.1/ui-sql-dashboard.md %}#upgrades-of-sql-transaction-isolation-level) graph in the DB Console to check whether any transaction is being upgraded from a weaker isolation level to `SERIALIZABLE`, and could therefore run differently on v24.1.

<h4 id="v24-1-0-cluster-settings">Key Cluster Setting Changes</h4>

The following changes should be reviewed prior to upgrading. Default cluster settings will be used unless you have manually set a value for a setting. This can be confirmed by checking the `system.settings` table (`select * from system.settings`) to view the non-default settings.

- `changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enable` is now deprecated. Instead, use the new [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `changefeed.default_range_distribution_strategy`. `changefeed.default_range_distribution_strategy='balanced_simple'` has the same effect as setting `changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enable=true`. It does not require `initial_scan='only'`, which was required by the old setting. [#115166][#115166]
- Added the [cluster setting]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}) `security.client_cert.subject_required.enabled` that enforces a mandatory requirement for the client certificate's role subject to be set. The subject can be defined through either the subject role option or by specifying the `root-cert-distinguished-name` and `node-cert-distinguished-name` properties. This setting applies to both RPC access and login via authCert. [#122368][#122368]
- The [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `sql.contention.record_serialization_conflicts.enabled` is now `on` by default. This means any [`40001` errors]({% link v23.2/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}) that are returned containing conflicting transaction information will be recorded by the contention registry, improving the ability to troubleshoot. For more information, refer to the [Insights page]({% link v24.1/ui-insights-page.md %}) documentation. [#116664][#116664]
- The new [cluster setting]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}) `storage.sstable.compression_algorithm` configures the compression algorithm used when compressing sstable blocks. Supported values are: "snappy" and "zstd" [snappy = `1`, zstd = `2`]. Changing the default of snappy to zstd can result in substantial performance improvement, however, the effects this change may be highly dependent on the workload and data, so experimentation is recommended before enabling zstd in production environments.
- The new setting `storage.wal_failover.unhealthy_op_threshold` allows you to set the latency threshold at which a WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) write is considered unhealthy. When exceeded, the node will attempt to write WAL entries to a secondary store's volume. For more information, refer to <v24.1/cockroach-start.md#write-ahead-log-wal-failover> [#120509][#120509]
- Added the `server.max_open_transactions_per_gateway` [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}). When set to a non-negative value, non-`admin` users cannot execute a query if the number of transactions open on the current gateway node is already at the configured limit. [#118781][#118781]
- Introduced the `server.redact_sensitive_settings.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings), which is false by default. If set to `true`, then the values of the following settings will be redacted when accessed through `SHOW` commands or other introspection interfaces. In the future, any other sensitive cluster settings that are added will be redacted as well. Users who have the `MODIFYCLUSTERSETTING` [privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/security-reference/authorization#managing-privileges) can always view the unredacted settings. [#117729][#117729]
    - `server.oidc_authentication.client_id`
    - `server.oidc_authentication.client_secret`
- The new boolean changefeed option [`ignore_disable_changefeed_replication`](../v24.1/create-changefeed.html#ignore-disable-changefeed), when set to `true`, prevents the changefeed from filtering events even if CDC filtering is configured via the `disable_changefeed_replication` [session variable](../v24.1/session-variables.html), `sql.ttl.changefeed_replication.disabled` [cluster setting](../v24.1/cluster-settings.html), or the `ttl_disable_changefeed_replication` [table storage parameter](../v24.1/alter-table.html#table-storage-parameters). [#120255][#120255]
- kvadmission.store.provisioned_bandwidth - Release note (ops change): The provisioned-rate field, if specified,
should no longer accept a disk-name or an optional bandwidth field. To
use the disk bandwidth constraint the store-spec must contain
provisioned-rate=bandwidth=<bandwidth-bytes/s>, otherwise the cluster
setting kv.store.admission.provisioned_bandwidth will be used.
  - TODO: Confirm that cluster setting is erroneously referencing its old name. Inquired with Eng.
  - Setting desc: If set to a non-zero value, this is used as the provisioned bandwidth (in bytes/s), for each store. It can be overridden on a per-store basis using the --store flag. Note that setting the provisioned bandwidth to a positive value may enable disk bandwidth based admission control, since admission.disk_bandwidth_tokens.elastic.enabled defaults to true.
- Add sql.txn.read_committed_isolation.enabled
- Add sql.show_ranges_deprecated_behavior.enabled
- Add sql.trace.session_eventlog.enabled
- Add changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enabled

- `changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enable` is now deprecated. Instead, use the new [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `changefeed.default_range_distribution_strategy`. `changefeed.default_range_distribution_strategy='balanced_simple'` has the same effect as setting `changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enable=true`. It does not require `initial_scan='only'`, which was required by the old setting. [#115166][#115166]
- The `cockroach connect` command has been removed. This command was [deprecated]({% link releases/v23.2.md %}#v23-2-0-deprecations) in CockroachDB v23.2. [#113893][#113893]
