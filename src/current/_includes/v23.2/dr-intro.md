CockroachDB is built to be [fault-tolerant and to recover automatically]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/demo-fault-tolerance-and-recovery.md %}), but sometimes disasters happen. A _disaster_ is any event that puts your cluster at risk, and usually means your cluster is experiencing [hardware failure](#hardware-failure), [data failure](#data-failure), or has [compromised security keys](#compromised-security-keys).
